This site is a collection of notes that I made while learning
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), I keep them all in a repo to
make it easy for me to manage them, and I publish it in case other
people find it useful (and so that I can point people here when they
ask about how I did something).

If you are just getting started with Kubernetes, I recommend starting
at [Setup > Getting Started](setup/getting-started).  If you go
through the setup steps in order it walks through setting up a cluster
from scratch, while introducing a bunch of useful tools along the way.
