Many apps are distributed as [Helm Charts](https://helm.sh/).  Helm
Charts are more complicated, but more flexible than regular YAML
manifests, so they are popular for more complicated applications, or
those with configurable installation options.

To prepare for installing Helm Charts, first install helm on your
workstation.

```sh
# Mac
brew install helm

# Windows:
choco install kubernetes-helm
```
